                    As a Bachelor of Computer Applications student, I am building a strong foundation in programming,
                    databases,
                    and web
                    development. Through my coursework and personal practice, I have developed small projects that
                    demonstrate
                    my
                    understanding of core concepts and my ability to apply them practically.
                </h3>

                <h3>
                    I am continuously improving my skills through class assignments, personal projects, and
                    self-learning,
                    aiming to take on
                    internships and larger projects in the upcoming semesters.
